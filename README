NAME
    Module::Manifest::Skip - MANIFEST.SKIP Manangement for Modules

SYNOPSIS
    From the command line:

        > perl -MModule::Manifest::Skip=create

    From Perl:

        use Module::Manifest::Skip;
        use IO::All;
    
        my $mms = Module::Manifest::Skip->new;
        # optional add and removes:
        $mms->add('^foo-bar$');
        $mms->remove('^foo$');
        $mms->remove(qr/\Q\bfoo\b/);
        io('MANIFEST.SKIP')->print($mms->text);

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: This module is mostly intended for module packaging frameworks to
    share a common, up-to-date "MANIFEST.SKIP" base. For example,
    Module::Install::ManifestSkip, uses this module to get the actual SKIP
    content. However this module may be useful for any module author.

    CPAN module authors use a MANIFEST.SKIP file to exclude certain well
    known files from getting put into a generated MANIFEST file, which would
    cause them to go into the final distribution package.

    The packaging tools try to automatically skip things for you, but if you
    add one of your own entries, you have to add all the common ones
    yourself. This module attempts to make all of this boring process as
    simple and reliable as possible.

    Module::Manifest::Skip can create or update a MANIFEST.SKIP file for
    you. You can add your own entries, and it will leave them alone. You can
    even tell it to not skip certain entries that it normally skips,
    although this is rarely needed.

USAGE
    Usually this module is called by wrapping modules. If you want this to
    be used by Module::Install, then you would put this:

        manifest_skip 'clean';

    in your Makefile.PL, and everything would be taken care of for you.

    If you want to simply create a MANIFEST.SKIP file from the command line,
    this handy syntax exists:

        > perl -MModule::Manifest::Skip=create

BEHAVIOR
    This module ships with a share file called share/MANIFEST.SKIP. This is
    the basis for all new MANIFEST.SKIP files. This module will look for an
    already existing MANIFEST.SKIP file and take all the text before the
    first blank line, and prepend it to the start of a new SKIP file. This
    allows you to put your own personal section at the top, that will not be
    overwritten later.

    It will then look for lines beginning with a dash followed by a space.
    Like this:

        - \bfoo\b
        - ^bar/
        - ^baz$

    It will remove each of these lines and any other lines that match the
    text after the dash/space. This allows you to override the default
    SKIPs.
